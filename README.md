Site Alert
------------

The Site Alert module is a lightweight solution for allowing site administrators to easily place an alert on their site, for example for maintenance downtime, or any general informational message. Alerts can be assigned a severity level. 

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.


Configuration
----------------

Enable the Site Alert module
Add the 'Site Alert' block to whichever layout you wish it to appear in. 

Differences from Drupal 7
-------------------------

Module modifications for Backdrop.

- The scheduling capability was removed. To regain this functionality consider using the
  [Block Scheduler](https://backdropcms.org/project/block_scheduler) module.
- WYSIWYG added for block content creation.
- Block configuration moved to the layout screen so content creation and placement are done in one step.
